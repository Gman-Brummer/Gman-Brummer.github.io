Holmes CTF 2025 was Hack The Box’s first-ever **defensive (Blue Team) CTF**.  
Instead of breaking into systems, participants took on the role of digital detectives: analyzing logs, memory dumps, and artifacts to piece together attacker behavior.  

Challenges were themed around Sherlock Holmes, with each scenario serving as a “case file” to solve. Categories spanned **Threat Intelligence, SOC analysis, DFIR, and Malware Analysis**.

| Category            | Name | Description | Difficulty |
|---------------------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Threat Intelligence** | [1: The Card](./the-card/report.md) | Holmes receives a breadcrumb from Dr. Nicole Vale — fragments from a string of cyber incidents across Cogwork-1. Each lead ends the same way: a digital calling card signed **JM**. | **Easy** |
| **SOC** | [2: The Watchman’s Residue](./the-watchmans-residue/report.md) | With help from D.I. Lestrade, Holmes acquires logs from a compromised MSP tied to the city’s financial core. The MSP’s AI service desk bot has been manipulated into leaking remote access keys — an old trick of Moriarty’s. | **Medium** |
| **DFIR** | [3: The Enduring Echo](./enduring-echo/report.md) | LeStrade passes a disk image to Watson. It’s one of the breach points, now showing abnormal CPU activity and anomalies in process logs. | **Easy** |
| **DFIR** | [4: The Tunnel Without Walls](./tunnel-without-walls/report.md) | A memory dump from a Linux machine reveals covert network connections, fake services, and unusual redirects. Holmes investigates how the attacker is manipulating the network. | **Hard** |
| **Malware Analysis** | [5: The Payload](./the-payload/report.md) | With the malware extracted, Holmes inspects its logic. The strain spreads silently across the network. Its goal? Not destruction — but persistence, and creating more “friends.” | **Hard** |

Holmes CTF 2025 pushes defenders to:

- **Analyze real artifacts**: logs, registry hives, memory dumps, malware.  
- **Reconstruct attacker behavior**: persistence, pivoting, credential theft, exfiltration.  
- **Map techniques to MITRE ATT&CK** for real-world relevance.  
- **Think like incident responders**, not just puzzle solvers.
